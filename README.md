## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This is not a production-ready project.  
It was built as a demonstration repository to show to Contabilidade.com my skills building responsive UIs with Next.js and TailwindCSS, while also sharing ideas, examples, and good practices.

## ðŸ”§ Working functions

Theme switcher: Easily toggle between light, dark and system modes using the icon at the top left corner of the page.

City selector: Add `?cidade=CITY_NAME` to the end of the URL to view the project customized for different cities.

Responsiveness: The layout automatically switches to card view on smaller devices for a better mobile experience.
